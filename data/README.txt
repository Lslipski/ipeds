Notes:

When downloading data from ipeds (https://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/datacenter/DataFiles.aspx), you have to choose a year and then choose a file. Older files tend to have been revised. I use these
revised files but rename them for ease of import. The latest versions (2023 as of last update) have also been renamed (dropping the "f2223" prefix. Name changes are documented below:


Original Name -> Rename
